title_description: "<p>Welcome. Iâ€™m a geospatial and information technology enthusiast who enjoys tinkering with software and looking at pretty pictures taken from space satellites or the coloured text of code in SublimeText; strongly biased toward thinking road lines and other shapes shown in QGIS or ArcGIS are more real than the street or football pitch out there. After the 8 to 4 day job and on weekends, I toil with FOSS4G, command lines and reading up on the trendy GI technologies or implementations."
