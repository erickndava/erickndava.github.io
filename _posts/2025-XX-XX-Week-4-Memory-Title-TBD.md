Went into the week with malloc() in mind. That is the one thin



Last week's [*Caesar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) challenge pushed my schedule out by a few days and I had to pick-up pace this week, *Week 3*. Had the content been entirely new, I would have needed more time on **arrays**. This week's focus was on thinking about solving problems better, ***thinking algorithmic-ally.*** A end-of class animation comparing ***Selection Sort***, ***Bubble Sort*** and  ***Merge Sort*** was priceless, succinctly illustrating good program design and efficiency in algorithms.

| *Execution Time* |

This week's content was overally easy going and comprehensible. I could correctly identify and distinguish, first time, the three sorting algorithms  by analysing the run-times, *sketched on the study note above.*

While working through the Problem Set 3, the small wins really kept the morale and drive to continue high. Incorrect use of a comparison operator can be code breaking. Using a debugging technique learnt in the course, viz printing output at certain points of the code, I was able to identify the problem with my code without using the IDE's Debugging Tools.

## Wheels Off . . . Collaborate

- Problem Set 3, tasks were increasing challenging. With the first two being quick wins and quite some warm up. With the third of the problems, the tri-cycle training wheels where completely-off! One could leverage on the previous task completed but that was just the first rung of a complex ladder system.  **Programmatic and algorithmic thinking** were scaled a notch. **Two dimensional arrays** were to be employed. The *Runoff* task, challenged one's ability to think in the **abstract**.

- For the first time I went out to look for help in a [Slack Community](https://cs50.edx.org/slack), one of the many CS50 communities. It wasn't long till I had a break and cracked the functions which were to be implemented.

-  Due to pressing work commitments. I have to renage my week on week plan for the course. I will continue on Week 4 in a week's time. Wow! That was a lot of weeks in a few sentences. Not very good design.
