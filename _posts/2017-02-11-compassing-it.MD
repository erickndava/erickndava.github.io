### Still Looking ? 
### GIS Specialist
I am  in the habit of Googling *"GIS"* job openings, first in my province of residence and then nationally. [CareerJet](http://www.careerjet.com/) and [Gumtree](https://www.gumtree.co.za/) are my go-to places. CareerJet is particularly good in that it aggregates posts from several job sites.  *Job Insecurity?* ~ far from it! I like to know how my industry is doing, job wise, and also just to check how employable and relevant I still am, a check against having decanted skills and a way of identifying areas of personal improvement. During this insightful 'pass-time' activity I couldn't help notice [one particular job](http://latitude-resource.co.za/vacancies/gis/gis-specialist-lr15055-cape-town-southern-suburbs) that persistently appeared in my searches, albeit evidently being re-posted , for more than 1 year!   

Well, as usual you may ~ [Cut To The Chase](https://worditout.com/word-cloud/2034809).

### Yardsticking
For the particular job above, I felt I was comfortable enough with the requisite skills to dive in. In some areas I wasn't 100% confident but was sure I could learn on the job in no time (*if the prospective employer had such time. But looking at 1 year of advertising? ~ the solution they had in place was good enough for now and could afford to wait before migrating it. Anyway...*). I hit upon the idea of preparing myself as if I was to take such a job. As a spin off I decided to aggregate ten *"GIS"* jobs within South Africa I thought were cool and get a sense of what was commonly being sought.

Add to it, during the beginning of the year I had come across a great [post](http://www.econetwireless.com/strive_masiyiwa_blog/index.php/pause-its-time-you-become-an-entrepreneur/) on what an Entrepreneur was and that an individual should be one at their workplace. This was going to be my aim in 2017.  I was off to a good start with [How Do I Get Started In Data Science](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/data-science-guides/data-science-getting-started-guide) from which I had also taken a hint on doing *'job analysis'*. So this year I would list skills I wanted to develop and improve on and work on these through the year. My quick list;

 - Improve on my SQL chops . . .SpatialSQL.
 - Improve on JavaScript . . . for WebMapping
 - Learn Python . . .for scripting.
 - Dig a little deeper into PostGRES (..and PostGIS) Admin
 - Play more with an online web GeoServer on Digital Ocean or OpenShift.

So I'll see how that compared with what the market required.


### Compassing It
GIS Jobs are variedly titled! For the same tasks and job description you find different banners in use. During this 'pseudo' job hunt I quickly discovered that GIS Developers were in demand. I ignored the curiosity to find out more and focus on what I was sure was comfortable with. Just avoiding the small voice in the head saying *'You must learn software engineering, have some software development experience, learn Java, master algorithm design....'*.STOP! The search string for all jobs was simply "GIS".

I chose the following job postings for the exercise.

1. [GIS Specialist](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/1.GIS%20Specialist%20-2015.pdf)
2. [GIS Engineer](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/2.GIS%20Engineer%20-%20Jan%202017.pdf)
3. [GIS Fascilitator/Manager](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/3.GIS%20Fascilitator%2C%20Manager%20-%20Jan%202017.pdf)
4. [Head GIS and Survey](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/4.Head%20GIS%20and%20Survey%20-%202017.pdf)
5. [Senior GIS Specialist](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/5.Senior%20GIS%20Specialist%20-%202017.pdf)
6. [Senior GIS Analyst](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/6.Senior%20GIS%20Analyst%20-%202016.pdf)
7. [GIS Business Analyst](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/7.GIS%20Business%20Analyst%20-%20Feb%202017.pdf)
8. [GIS Specialist](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/8.GIS%20Specialist%20-2017.pdf)
9. [Economic Development and GIS Data Quality Researcher](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/9.Economic%20Development%20and%20GIS%20Data%20Quality%20Researcher.pdf)
10. [Business Analyst (GIS)](https://github.com/erickndava/Scratch_Store/blob/master/10.Business%20Analyst%20(GIS)%20-%202017.pdf)

### A Play On Words

To complete the exercise, I aggregated all the text used in the above job posts (*skippping stuff like  email your CV to..blah blah*). The aim was to have a sense of responsibilities given and skills sought.

I plugged the combined text from the ten job posts and plugged them into [Word ItOut](https://worditout.com/word-cloud/create) for a word cloud. Why? The thing just looks nice doesn't it? Seriously. As an aside I figured the larger sized words mean that they appears more often ~ viz is what potential employees are looking for in candidates. After the first run I found some not so useful words appearing often. I pre-processed the combined text - removing words like - South Africa, Salary, City,...I finally ended up with:

My text from job posts had 1051 words. With a minimum frequency of 5 words, 95 words were displayed on the word cloud.

For overkill I also created a 10 word 'summary'

### Last Word
Interestingly, the technical terms are obviated by words like team, development, support e.t.c. SQL doesn't feature as I guessed it would. Development and experience are dominant. Employers must be looking for persons with systems/ procedures setup skills (*Skills is mentioned significantly too!*). These positions are likely non entry level kind, requiring ***experience***. For now I'll stick to my quick list above for skills development and give less weight to results from this exercise. 

### #postscript

* This surely is not the best way to do a trend analysis of job requirements. I figure something that crawls the web and scraps job sites by South Africa domain names is the way to go. The method used here is rudimentary and creates a cool word cloud graphic to paste on some wall. 
* Results from this exercise didn't produce the Wow! Effect one would get from a [visualisation](https://ziosframe.carto.com/viz/e18ec19c-ed15-11e6-8105-0e3ebc282e83/embed_map). It wasn't what I expected at all. The black box spewed something off what I expected. To see that SQL didn't make it to the word cloud? Where is database?
