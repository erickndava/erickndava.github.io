### On Names

So, I decided to start a blog and I picked a name - **neaRThings**, my
succinct version of [Tobler’s first law of
geography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler's_first_law_of_geography),
should reflect the domain I am passionate about - ‘geo’ and atleast,
well, be intriguing enough.

Nowadays people *don’t* have time for verbose articles and I’m glad
you’re on the third sentence already! My few professional years have led
me to realise that
[tinkerers](http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/tinkerer) make
things happen. I watched the [Leaflet Mapping
library](http://leafletjs.com/) grow from being just a speck on GitHub
to the time it took on the [Google Maps
API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/). I
also witnessed [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) hire this [Leaflet
dude](https://www.mapbox.com/about/team/#vladimir-agafonkin) as I
watched them evolve since I was following them closely because of
TileMill.(*Evolved to Mapbox Studio*)

Tinkering gives one an edge, with contentment, without the restrain of
structured seminars, classroom lessons or guided training. As a tinkerer
I can quit when I want to (*rarely*) without feeling guilty about it.
Research while troubleshooting, opens up (*often unwanted*) divergent
paths from the task at hand and the tools, technologies and tutorials
stumbled upon end up being appended to an ever growing \~ TODO!

### Hencefrom

I learned about [QGIS](http://qgis.com) when it was still 0.7 (*It’s at
2.8 at the date of writing this article*), I was just about to leave
varsity then, later ditched the prospects of becoming a Land Surveyor
post graduation after having been made to wait the whole day by the
*would-be-mentor*, only to be told to come back the next day. The first
GIS related job was with an institution that had spreadsheets for a Land
Information System - I was heart broken. This was nothing near what had
been said in the interview and fell far short of what I had read from
[ArcUser Magazines](http://esri.com/news/ArcUser/) at college. A few
years later I met a mentor like no other, Johann Groenewald of
[Tracks4Africa](http://www.tracks4africa.co.za). He led me on a
teach-yourself path and gave me room to do it. I discovered QGIS again
and [PostGIS](http://postgis.net) as well this time. Things have not
been the same since.

(Aside: *you may want to readup of T4A products and check out their
[Africa Map](http://tracks4africa.co.za/maps/africa/). Their business
model still befuddles me.* )

Along the way I discovered
[gis.stackexchange.com](http://gis.stackexchange.com) and jumped onto
[twitter](https://twitter.com/erickndava). I was already faithfully
following geobloggers amongst them [James
Fee](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/) - for starters, then the list
grew to warrant the use of [Feedly](http://feedly.com) and not
unparsable bookmarks in the browser. During my regular reading I bumbed
into a statement that almost described my situation and led to serious
introspection. It was by Paul Ramsey on [his
blog](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2012/10/spatial-it-vs-gis.html).

> “…a career where 90% of the activity is actually in data creation
> (digitization monkey!) and publication (map monkey!), not in
> analysis…”

It was an eye opener regarding where I wanted to be professionally. Ever
since I have been endeavouring to conform to the
[Spatial-IT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01yrhqCro7I) padigm.I also
took to heart the advice he gives in one of his presentations:

> “Learn something new or hard. Learn something uncomfortable.”

And that was not the last on the matter as I kept coming across similar
thought provoking and spurring tweets:

Well, I had left varsity thinking spatial was special!

### Henceto

![Compass](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Compass_align.jpg "Direct Thyself")
Direct thyself.

From the one and many blog posts I have read. I drew the conclusion -
the best way to learn a technology, programming language or tool, is to
be handson with it. Get to do some project with **it**. Thus the
direction I am taking is to learn as much as I can through projects that
come to my mind … light bulb moments.

### Another Blog?

The day job doesn’t necessarily task me enough in the directions of the
many tools and technologies out there. Sufficient for a day’s work are
the tools in the office. For diversity I choose to waddle the “forest”.
On this blog I intend to share my thoughts and experiences. Several
posts on career development I’ve read up on recommend blogging for
various reasons. I decided the following were relevant to me:

-   **Improve my writing skills.** *- I like poetry and ‘twisted’
    english. So I will see how much of that can be used in technical
    writings. Metaphors say?*

-   **Cement the things I learn.** *- By writing down procedures, that
    forces one to think about it, cementing the concepts in the head and
    hopefully birthing alternative approaches.*

-   **Re-share what I have Read-up** *- rewrite what I would have
    learnt. Often I have used steps of ‘how-to’ from more than one blog
    post to get something right! Let others rediscover it. So I see no
    harm in having three pseudo-identical articles on the web.*

### What Tree?

Yes, I am using the Windows Operating system. I have had my stint with
[Linux](http://knoppix.net), did 101 data recoveries from broken
Windows. At one time I became an OS ethusiast, carrying around several
distros on 3.5 inch floppy disks. I even damned the machines I was using
daily, calling them Windoze.The revolutionalism got me nowhere! The food
on my table and the railment I gait in, have been earned from spending
atleast 8 hours a day using this operating system. Working against it
doesn’t help but rather with it. Regardless, I can presently fire-off
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) off my
[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) installation. To add to my
consolation, [one of the
‘geo’-bloggers](http://nathanw.net/2013/03/23/my-toolset/) I read after
makes continued use shameless.

(Aside: *At one point in my career I had to unistall Ubuntu from 30 PCs
or so to install a Windows OS just because the adoption of OpenOffice
and such just couldn’t happen. It was retrogressive to try and enforce
it.*)

### In The Meantime

off to a project on *GitHub for Geo* - the thought “I need to learn
JavaScript fast”, dogging my path after 2014 end of year
geo-discussions, [a turf
call!](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/turf-gis-for-web-maps/)

### \#postscript

#### The cost (gain) of the first post

It has been the ascent, albeit slow, of steep and slippery learning
curves and unfamiliar terittory. There was serious *tyre-kicking* just
to get the framework properly set-up - git, Ruby, ruby-gems… had to
resort to using [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) when
SSH keys and things became a tangle while setting up git (command line).

Setting up Ruby was toughest, top-hit Google Search Octopress setup
tutorials led me into infinite loops of troubleshooting. After weeks of
trying, I had to do the whole Ruby setup ‘thing’ all over after finding
this [excellent and straight forward article on the
matter](http://www.techelex.org/setup-octopress-windows7/). In a
nutshell tools and apps that were used:

-   **[Octopress](http://octopress.org)** - *[Tool] Setting up,
    customising for font, but then git was a pre-requisite!*
-   **[GIT](http://git-scm.com/)** - *[Technology] The tears and sweat
    of ensuring it installed and was working.*
-   **[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)** - *[Language]
    Learning the language. Luckily Cheatsheets made it easier.*
-   **[SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com)** - *[Tool] Learning the
    Keyboard shortcuts. Searching for useful plugins. Must say
    [OmniMarkupPreviewer](https://github.com/timonwong/OmniMarkupPreviewer)
    did come in very handy while editing the blog post*

Well, I must say the temptation to dump the Octopress path and go for
WordPress (on Openshift) was great at one time but I prevailed.
Tinkerers tinker until it works!
