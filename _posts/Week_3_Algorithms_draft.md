Last week's [*Caesar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) challenge pushed my schedule out by a few days and I had to pick-up pace this week, *Week 3*. Had the content been entirely new, I would have needed more time on **arrays**. This week's focus was on thinking about solving problems better, ***thinking algorithmic-ally.*** A end-of class animation comparing ***Selection Sort***, ***Bubble Sort*** and  ***Merge Sort*** was priceless, succinctly illustrating good program design and efficiency in algorithms.

The content overally was easy going and comprehensible. I could correctly identify and distinguish, first time, the three sorting algorithms  by analysing the run-times, *sketched on in the study note above.*

While working through the Problem Set 3, the small wins do really keep the morale high. Incorrect use of a comparison operator can be code breaking. Using debugging techniques learnt in the course so far, like printing output at certain points of the code, I was able to isolate the problem without using the IDE's Debugging Tool.

## Debugging The Way to a Solution

Most fascinating this week was the section of debugging - using CS50's '*Debug50*' . I like seeing 'under-the-hood'. It turned out I had to use this tool extensively for one of the Challenges of the Problem Set. Watching variables change dynamically, albeit slowly, helps one quickly identify issues with the code. I notice with the course resource material (Main Lecture, Section and Shots), concepts are rehashed several times and from various angles, you will eventually 'get it.'

The theme of Good Program Design kept popping up and code was edited 'live' and several approaches demonstrated. 

I had some ecstatic moments of glory and self celebration, having coded a word capitaliser from scratch. Through a self imposed coding sprint, I tackled one of the challenges - *Readability* from start to finish without first looking at the hints and helps that come with the problem specs. Much time was spend with *Debug50* as the program passed some and failed other correctness tests.  When I eventually looked at the proposed approach, it was satisfying to notice my approach was not that much different.

## Thinking Programmatically, This Week's Take-Aways

- One of the challenges this week, *Scrabble,* pushed my limits of **programmatic thinking**. I couldn't quickly crack the problem and find an approach. I had to go through the solution guide without a ready approach of my own. I learnt that it's okay to not know and it is all part of developing programmatic thinking muscle. My understanding of arrays improved as I could understand the solution easily, but getting the idea/ approach is what I lacked.

- **Pseudo-coding** really helps with the thought process and helps break down the problem into bite-sized parts. You quickly realise where functions can be employed and you're able to **abstract** as much as possible. This isolation of 'small solutions' makes the problem look much smaller and surmountable. 

- This week the training wheels are still on but the pushes and directions are became fewer and fewer. A very 'weak' framework to tackling the problem set is provided. I had a lot of **Rubber-ducking**, with *CS50 Duck Debugger* and a lot of ***Debug50*** as well. With the third task of the problem set, it took me a while to notice a *variable assignment* error which produced partially correct output. It was an exciting time debugging and similarly frustrating since I knew the code was correct, that's when the Duck really helped. 

- With a 'correct' and functioning program at hand I asked the AI to check design, ***design50***. My program worked alright but there we a number of design change suggestions. My programmatic thinking is improving. I should focus as well on **improving design**.
