| *The Gradebook - Looking at Progress* |

So after submission of Week 5 Problem Set solutions, the above is my current progress. Now just a little over the halfway mark of the course. I foresee of course that the Final Project (FP) will take longer than a week. The week's lecture material was quite comprehensible, relaxing almost. Dr Malan has a way of explaining complicated concepts from basic building blocks, from the ground up. The video clip aids, such as the t-shirts from a box and those from hangers, really drove home the concepts of Stacks, FIFO and LIFO.

The previous week on [memory](https://erickndava.github.io/cs50/data/science/pgdip/journey/gis/2025/07/31/Week-4-Pointers-Memory-and-16-Digits-to-Work-With/), was a bit intense as the code became more complex. Had the motivation for studying not been strong, Week 4 was a good time to quit. But, as I have learned from *[Learning Hard Topics](https://erickndava.github.io/cs50/data/science/pgdip/journey/gis/2025/07/31/Week-4-Pointers-Memory-and-16-Digits-to-Work-With/)*, some topics are challenging like that. With the content of Week 5, It's clear now that was necessary foundation. The week is a culmination of C and will veer off to Python in Week 6 (*looking forward to that*). It feels truly like a peak of the course and I am expecting to now plateau. 

From so much use of loops and defaulting to 'i' as a loop variable I concluded that the **i** stands for any of - **i**terate, **i**nitialise, **i**ndex.

## Being Practical with C


Going over the Inheritance (*Problem Set 5*),  one really appreciates how everything learnt up to this point - assignment (*now of pointers*), arrays, memory, loops, conditionals, truth checking and more, ties together. The utility of the C Programming language is demonstrated through implementation of a practical biology 'problem' - determining permutations of Blood Type.

I couldn't help pondering though, the experience by someone encountering this computer science material for the 'first time', in my limited time circumstance would fare. A week-by-week tempo,  is manageable  for someone who can spare a few hours a day delving the content and not necessarily a full-time worker without a burn of midnight oil.

## What I learnt About Complex Problems

Problem Set 5, Part 2, Speller was the most challenging, yet, of the course. It has so many 'moving parts' i.e. functions and also incorporated a lot, if not all, of the concepts learnt so far.  I perceive the [objectives I set out](https://erickndava.github.io/cs50/data-science/pgdip-journey/2025/06/15/Why-I-Took-Harvard's-CS50-as-a-Mid-Career-Spatial-Scientist/) at the beginning of the course are gradually being met. Some take-aways:

- I learnt (*again*) and got reinforcement that breaking a problem into sub-problems should be a default approach when tackling a complex task. For each of the 5 functions to be completed, I could independent  apply the most appropriate logic to each.

- **Benchmarking** is a fascinating way of improving one's code and algorithms. I found the exercise of **improving the efficiency** of my already functional code exciting. The Ideas of ***good program design***, I was experiencing in practice.

- The many functions and and code files other people had written which I had to work with, made me understand better the concept of ***code collaboration***.

- Walking away from a challenge and coming back later seem to be working for me versus banging my head on the keyboard until I get it. There are instances though where once you get a 'scent' to cracking the problem, you can't detach until you get it done, then only walking away with the delight of success.
