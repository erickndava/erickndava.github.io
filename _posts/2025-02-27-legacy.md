The image above was highlight of an email I received mid-February this year,a few days after I had demonstrated my spatial data visualisation abilities to a recruiter. One of my [favourite](https://erickndava.github.io/thought/idea/2016/12/18/spatial-doodle-the-every-time-sensor/) posts which relied on CartoDB came to mind. I got the motivation to preserve this portion of my portfolio of work.

#### Just [Cut to The Chase.](#head1234)

#### **Early Clouds**

This made me reminiscence all the free, limited use cloud services that scratched a tinkeror's itch.How at one time I used RedHat's OpenShift to host [GeoServer](https://github.com/w8r/openshift-geoserver?tab=readme-ov-file)

and ran a PostGIS server on Digital Ocean, just to test the PostgreSQL database connection abilities of QGIS.

#### **Migrating Maps**

The email from CartoDB gave the next steps to the email heading
> Your CARTO legacy account will be retired on March 31st, 2025
A new CARTO platform had been launched nearly 4 years earlier (2021).

I determined I was indeed still using the legacy platform. I signed up to the new platform.

> My list of Carto maps.

On there, I also had some [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) associated maps. These I didn't care to preserve. Additionally there were datasets, linked to the maps, which needed to be preserved.

#### **Data Where**house

The 'new' CARTO platform had some catchy requirements for a tinkeror but luckily, ... I could use CARTO's own **Carto Data Warehouse**. However, data needed to be migrated and maps to be recreated.

I created an account on the New CARTO platform. Indeed it carries the shiny feel of current technologies.

Downloaded datasets from the Legacy account, chose the CSV file format.

Uploaded the data (7) into the data warehouse connection - Carto Data Warehouse (carto_dw).

### <a name="head1234"></a>No Free Lunch!

[Carto.com](Carto.com) is a breath of fresh air. The tools in there are easy to use and quite intuitive. Unfortunately for a part-time tinkeror, 14 days is not a very long time. For my use-case, experimentation and blogging this is end of the road. The link to my maps will become dead...but gladly the methodology remains documented.
