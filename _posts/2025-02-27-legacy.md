The image above was highlight of an email I received mid-February this year,a few days after I had demonstrated my spatial data visualisation abilities to an interested party. One of my [favourite](https://erickndava.github.io/thought/idea/2016/12/18/spatial-doodle-the-every-time-sensor/) posts which relied on CartoDB came to mind. I got the motivation to preserve this portion of my portfolio of work.

#### Just [Cut to The Chase.](#head1234)

#### **Early Cloud**

This made me reminisce all the free, limited use cloud services that scratched a tinkeror's itch.How at one time I used RedHat's OpenShift to host [GeoServer](https://github.com/w8r/openshift-geoserver?tab=readme-ov-file) and ran a PostGIS server on Digital Ocean, just to test the PostgreSQL database connection abilities of QGIS. It is magic to see a table turn to vectors for someone whose background in spatial science is a GIS software environment.

#### **Migrating Maps**

The email from CartoDB gave the next steps to the email heading
> Your CARTO legacy account will be retired on March 31st, 2025
A new CARTO platform had been launched nearly 4 years earlier (2021).

I determined I was indeed still using the legacy platform. I signed up to the new platform.

There were also some [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) associated maps. These I didn't care to preserve. Additionally there were datasets, linked to the maps, which needed to be preserved.

#### **Data Where**house

The 'new' CARTO platform had some catchy requirements for a tinkeror but, luckily... I could make use of their own **Carto Data Warehouse**. However, data needed to be migrated and maps to be recreated.

I created an account on the New CARTO platform. Indeed it carries the shiny feel of 2025 web technologies.

+ Downloaded datasets from the Legacy account, chose the CSV file format.
+ Uploaded the data (7) into the data warehouse connection - Carto Data Warehouse (carto_dw).
+ Default import settings on data types are fine but not when time is converted to text.
+ I fiddled with TIME, TIMESTAMP and DATE till I had the GPS Logs data correctly formatted.

#### **~~No~~ Yes Visualisation Here**

Before spending more effort in coming up with a visualisation, I reviewed Carto's plans. There is none free there - except trial. So I reluctantly stopped there. Whatever I was going to create here, was going to last for 14 days. Well, I received an onboarding email from Carto while I was still busy with this blog post. I explained that I was not going to complete the migration because there was no (free) plan to meet my use case of the platform. To my delight, Carto responded a few hours later informing my plan had been migrated to CARTO Cloud Native.

### <a name="head1234"></a>~~No~~More Free Lunch!

[Carto.com](https://carto.com/) is a breath of fresh air. The tools in there are easy to use and quite intuitive. Unfortunately for a part-time tinkeror, 14 days is not a very long time. For my use-case, experimentation and blogging, this is end of the road. The link to my maps will become dead...but gladly the methodology remains documented.
