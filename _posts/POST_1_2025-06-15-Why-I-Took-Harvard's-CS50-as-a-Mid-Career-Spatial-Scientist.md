At the beginning of Q2 this year, I decided to pursue formal studies in data science.  An online, self-paced course wasn't motivating enough. I wanted something that has monitored learning and deadlines, with a deeper take of the the subject matter and having guardrails to spur me to finish. I looked around and found the [PGDip in Industrial Engineering:  Data Science at Stellenbosch University](https://ie-datascience.sun.ac.za/postgraduate-diploma-in-engineering/). It has a great delivery mode for working professionals and covers all the essential topics of data science according to the [Curriculum](https://ie-datascience.sun.ac.za/postgraduate-diploma-in-engineering/#Compulsory-Data-Science-Modules).

 
## Why Data Science Now?
Getting to a spatial analysis requires a great deal of data management and cleaning, I have had my share of that through my career. So, as part of upskilling strategy I have been thinking about and working on :
 
> strengthening my data analysis skills to become a Spatial Data Scientist, aiming to seat myself at the intersection of spatial data analysis and data science.

I self evaluated to check on some personal traits justifying why steer in that direction

1.  I love combing through data and I appreciate a good data wrangle. [Blogged a series](https://erickndava.github.io/hands-on/2019/06/20/a-datascience-doodle-1-the-data/) sometime ago.

2. Pushed the boundaries of excel with 1 Million records - *If that counts as Big Data.*

3. While working with data, my aim has been to get to the spatial component and get [cartographic output](https://erickndava.github.io/thought/idea/2016/12/10/anything-for-a-map-part-0/), giving other data elements scant attention. Now is the time to change that and prod the data more.

5. I have  worked with many and large datasets before but, my approach has been largely, [brute force](https://erickndava.github.io/hands-on/2019/06/20/a-datascience-doodle-1-the-data/), labour intensive and rudimentary. Through data science studies, I can leverage programmatic approaches to data wrangling.


## Taking Havard's CS50
 
 One of the [requirements](https://ie-datascience.sun.ac.za/postgraduate-diploma-in-engineering/#Admission-Requirements) of the PostGrad Diploma is studies in Computer programming. They also recommend, among other courses, taking Harvard's [CS50](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) to meet this requirement. I chose to take this route even though I had done CT130- Computer Science for Engineers. That was 25 years ago and the focus Language was [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)). For my undergrad research project I delved in [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)). Over the years though I also have dubbled in C, recently [R](https://erickndava.github.io/hands-on/2019/06/20/a-datascience-doodle-1-the-data/). Some JavaScript and HTML in a [Web Mapping Project](https://erickndava.github.io/pioneer-column-map/index.html). So computer code, I can understand code fairly well and I can think programmatically to an extent.
 
Taking CS50, I aim to: 
  - Relearn Computer Science concept, bringing structure to the knowledge and skill I acquired over time as a spatial scientist. 
  - Get a good grasp of Computer Science Concepts like, picking from memory, pointers in C.
  - Have a fresh and solid base when starting the PGDip studies

## Documenting The Journey
I enjoy writing, so I will start a blog series designed to document my experience with Harvard's CS50. In addition to completing the course and getting a certificate, this chronicle should hopefully act as evidence/ motivation for use when applying for admission to the PGDip in Industrial Engineering - Data Science at Stellenbosch University.

With the help of ChatGPT, I settled for a 12 week schedule to complete CS50, giving enough time to the application deadline. October 2025. Tomorrow I start!
