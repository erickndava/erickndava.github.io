## About
<p>
  At a time I wanted to be an astronaut/ cosmonaut. Even went on to chronicle my star observations in a journal, a toy telescope could have helped. Time progressed and then I couldn't miss an episode of [The Mechanical Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mechanical_Universe). Computers happened (in my life) and I poked in the MS DOS Window with fascination for hours on end.

 Geo became my passion of focus through 5 years of tertiary education. Looking through theodolites and calculating 'huge' matrices in Adjustment of Survey Observations. During one of the crash course AutoCAD session, I typed "Recover", from intuition in the command line and saved a colleague's project from oblivion. From then on my affinity for computers grew, leading me to take the [GIS](https://gisgeography.com/what-gis-geographic-information-systems/) stream of the GeoInformatics: Surveying degree program I was studying.

<p>
It has been 13 years developed and I have bumped into GitHub, Sublime Text, QGIS, ArcGIS, PostGIS and blog posts. I enjoy tinkering with software and looking at pretty pictures taken from space satellites or the coloured text of code in SublimeText; strongly biased toward thinking road lines and other shapes shown in QGIS or ArcGIS are more real than the street or football pitch out there. After the 8 to 4 day job and on weekends, I toil with FOSS4G, command lines and reading up on the trendy GI technologies or implementations.

Currently I am beginning  to revive my love for statistics and I am a wannabe be Spatial Data Scientist/ Spatial Data Engineer and all those cool and trendy titles.
